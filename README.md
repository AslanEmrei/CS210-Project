# BIST100 & Spotify Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project is part of the SabancÄ± University - CS210 Introduction to Data Science course. It explores the connection between financial market behavior and personal music preferences by analyzing two different datasets:

1. 1-Year Weekly Historical Data of BIST100 (Borsa Istanbul)  
2. 1-Year Personal Spotify Usage Data

## Project Motivation
As a beginner investor, I have always been curious about the interplay between my financial decisions and personal habits. This project aims to explore whether changes in the stock market, specifically in BIST100 where I do my investments mostly, influence my music preferences and listening behavior. By analyzing these datasets, I hope to uncover trends and correlations that reflect how fluctuations in my investments might affect my mood and music choices. This personalized approach not only allows me to better understand my own patterns but also provides a unique perspective on combining financial and behavioral data.

## Data Sources
- BIST100 Dataset: Weekly historical data for one year, sourced from a financial platform or API.  
- Spotify Dataset: One year of personal music consumption data, exported through Spotify's user data request feature.

## Future Plan

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
   - Analyze trends in stock market data (e.g., price movements, volume changes).
   - Explore Spotify usage patterns (e.g. peak listening times).
   - Visualize relationships and anomalies in both datasets.

2. *Correlation Analysis:*
   - Investigate potential correlations between BIST100 fluctuations and changes in music preferences.
   - Determine if time shifts, reflected in music choices, align with stock market performance.

3. *Machine Learning Models:*
   - Build predictive models to assess music preferences based on stock market changes.
   - Use clustering techniques to group similar music patterns based on market trends.

4. *Insights and Reporting:*
   - Summarize findings in a comprehensive report.
   - Visualize key takeaways using interactive plots.

5. *Repository Updates:*
   - Regularly update this repository with analysis scripts, visualizations, and documentation.
